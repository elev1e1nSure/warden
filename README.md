# warden

CLI computer control agent. Go TUI + Python backend + Ollama.

## stack

| layer | technology |
|---|---|
| frontend | go 1.23+, bubbletea, lipgloss |
| backend | python 3.11+, aiohttp |
| llm | ollama (qwen3:8b) |
| computer use | pyautogui, pillow |
| browser | playwright |
| search | duckduckgo-search |

## architecture

```
go tui (bubbletea)
    ↓ HTTP NDJSON
python backend (aiohttp, localhost:8765)
    ↓
ollama
    ↓
[powershell] [filesystem] [screenshot] [mouse/keyboard] [browser] [search]
```

frontend and backend are separated: TUI knows nothing about Ollama, backend knows nothing about UI.

## launch

```bash
# From the go/ directory:
cd go

# launcher starts backend + frontend together
go run ./cmd/warden

# or build and run
go build -o warden.exe ./cmd/warden
./warden.exe
```

backend starts on `localhost:8765`, automatically starts ollama and downloads the model if needed.

## tools

| name | description |
|---|---|
| `powershell` | PowerShell commands (Windows PowerShell, `pwsh` if available) |
| `bash` | Deprecated alias for `powershell` |
| `file_read` | read file |
| `file_write` | write file (creates folders) |
| `file_delete` | delete file, only within cwd |
| `file_list` | list files and folders |
| `clipboard` | read / write clipboard |
| `screenshot` | take a screenshot |
| `mouse` | move, click, right_click, double_click, scroll |
| `keyboard` | type, press (hotkey) |
| `browser_open` | open URL in user's browser |
| `browser_read` | read page text |
| `browser_screenshot` | screenshot page |
| `youtube_search` | search YouTube videos |
| `google_search` | web search (DuckDuckGo) |

## modes

| mode | behavior |
|---|---|
| **Leashed** (`/leash`) | Every tool call is classified by `agent/safety.py`. Safe commands run immediately. Confirm commands require user approval. Blocked commands are rejected and the model sees the block as a tool result. |
| **Unleashed** (`/unleash`) | Safe and confirm-level commands run without confirmation. Blocked commands are still rejected. Use with caution. |

## confirmation

When a tool call requires confirmation, the TUI shows:
- **what** will run (command / path / action)
- **why** it was flagged (risk details)
- **keys**: `y` to confirm, `Enter` / `Esc` / `n` to cancel

Confirmations time out after 5 minutes (auto-cancel).

## slash commands

Entered in the message field:

| command | action |
|---|---|
| `/unleash` | Unleashed — dangerous commands without confirmation |
| `/leash` | Leashed — confirmation for dangerous commands |
| `/reset` | Reset session and cancel all pending confirmations |
| `/thinking` | Toggle model reasoning |

## security

Risk classification is done by `agent/safety.py`, not the model:

- **safe**: read-only commands (`Get-ChildItem`, `git status`, `screenshot`, `browser_read`, `file_read` inside workspace)
- **confirm**: file writes, installs, mouse clicks, keyboard input, external URLs, process kills, unknown binaries
- **blocked**: recursive forced delete, encoded commands, `Invoke-Expression` with remote content, disk format, registry/system changes, file delete outside workspace

Path safety uses `Path.resolve()` with containment checks. UNC paths, device paths (`\\.\`, `\\?\`), and traversal (`../`) are blocked.

PowerShell reference with risk markers: `.warden/powershell-reference.md`

## tests

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest agent/
```

Safety classification is covered by `agent/test_safety.py` — run it after any change to `agent/safety.py`.

## model

Recommended: `qwen3:8b`

```bash
ollama run qwen3:8b
```
